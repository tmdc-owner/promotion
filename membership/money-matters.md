It is expected to be about $30,000 for 3 bedroom apartments.

Current estimate is that this (with overheads) will total about $200,000 per year.

At this point the pricing is proposed to be fairly arbitrarily set at $4,000 per unit. This should be less than about 1% of the capital cost of the unit. For comparison, for profit developers need to have this be over 20% of the capital cost of a unit.

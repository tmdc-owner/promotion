## Introduction

_The TMDC Initiative is organized as a **program** composed of multiple time-bound, outcome-oriented projects._
_Each project aligns with a specific implementation phase and contributes toward our collective mission to establish community-owned housing infrastructure._

If the [Initiative Section](/initiative/) explains the theory and phases, this section shows how it's being actively delivered.

### Active & Upcoming Projects

<ul>
{% assign sorted_projects = site.projects | sort: 'quarter' %}

      ({{ project.phase }} | {{ project.quarter }} | 
      <strong>{{ project.status | capitalize }}</strong>)
    </small><br />
    <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">{{ project.summary }}</span>

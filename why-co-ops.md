## Why Co-Ops

Non profit housing co-ops are corporations that provide housing to their members. It is controlled by a board elected by its members. Each member provides a member loan and pays monthly housing charge (rent) to cover the capital and operating costs (including mortgage payments and savings for large repairs and replacements). The housing charges are set by a general members meeting.

They are one of a number of kinds of organizations that subscribe to the [Rochdale Principles](rochdale.html)

The fundamental advantage of co-ops is that the charges cover the actual cost of the co-op, without paying the landlord's profits. Over time the difference tends to become larger.

There are other prosocial advantages of co-ops. Notably, practise with democratic institutions. This may be even more pronounced with people who grow up in co-ops.

The Co-op Housing Federation of Toronto enhances this with diversity scholarships for co-op members.

Co-ops are not all sweetness and light. The trouble with co-ops is that people have to co-operate.

They are democracies. Democracy is not a spectator sport. It requires your engagement.

The good news is that you are in charge, so you have a say in what happens.

The bad news is that you are in charge, so you are responsible.

## Types of Co-Ops

### Development Co-ops

All co-ops typically have the same control structure. The membership elects a board which controls the details of operating the organization. The membership also passes by-laws that specify the structure of the co-op and other foundational issues. These by-laws require two-thirds super majorities to pass. The other requirement is that the members appoint the auditors. Beyond this the members may direct the board by passing motions with simple majorities.

There is also staff who do the day to day work. For employment law (confidentiality) reasons the staff are employees of the board as opposed to being directly employed by the membership.

In this case the current expectation is that there is a lot of early work by the board and the membership to make initial decisions about how to develop housing co-ops but that this could possibly stabilize into annual members meetings and quarterly board meetings.

There is a waiting list. The people on the waiting list are the members of the organization.

The list is mostly first come, first served. The exception is people who sell property to the organization. They get to be at the top of the list for the particular co-op. The point here is to accommodate people who want to downsize without leaving the neighbourhood. This will also encourage people to sell to the organization. It is expected that this forms a high enough bar that queue jumping will not be an issue.

To get on to the waiting list the applicant needs to sign documents acknowledging issues involved in living in a co-op and their willingness to live co-operatively and provide a member loan.

They will also need to open an escrow account. This account is designed to cover the member loan for the housing co-op. The current design calls for 5% of the capital costs to be the member loan. The escrow account is a standard investment account all of which belongs to the applicant. The board determines the investment supplier to use. The member may make deposits on the account but may only withdraw money by closing out the account and leaving the co‑op.

When a new building project is proposed, space in the building (and a corresponding membership in the particular co‑op) is offered to members starting at the top of the list. It is at this point that members must have the member loan money. They will also have to pass a screening process, normally an interview and a credit check. It is an open question as to whether this done by the development co-op or the housing co‑op.

Members without enough money in their escrow account to pay the member loan on a new building remain members. If an opening occurs in an existing building for which they can pay the member loan they can apply to that co-op. This means that there is a common waiting list for all the co-ops developed this way.

#### Staffing

The minimum staffing during the start up period (before enough units get built to support housing co-op staff, about 25) would be 1 general co-ordinator, 1 part time bookkeeper, and 1 part time maintenance person (after the first building). After the start up period the maintenance person would transfer to the housing co-op.

If as and when the building rate scales up, the increased staffing costs will be supported by increased income from fees paid by the housing co-op as part of the capital costs.

#### Pricing

In this context pricing is the charge for development services provided by the development co-op to the housing co-op paid out of the capital cost of the building. It needs to be break even, but not much more than that.

### Unsubsidized not for profit housing co-ops

This document is about unsubsidized not for profit housing co-ops. This is an introductory text, it does not precisely describe all the details. If you understand co-ops created under government programs you should understand these.

They differ from co-ops created with government subsidies in a few ways. Notably, there is no government control or oversight, which also implies there are no exemptions from the rules governing rental accommodation. The obvious issue is that all of the Landlord and Tenant Act applies, including rent review. This should have no significance until the mortgage is paid off. A minor point is that they are subject to standard accounting rules from the start (this makes budget reporting slightly harder).

Housing co-ops are corporations that provide housing to their members. Each member provides a member loan and pays monthly rent to cover the capital and operating costs (including mortgage payments).

Co-ops are democratically controlled organizations. The control is mostly exercised through elected boards. In existing co-ops the budget (and therefor the rent) is passed by the membership. They also pass bylaws controlling the operation of the co-op.

Co-ops are not always sweetness and light. A classic line is that “the trouble with co-ops is that people have to co-operate”. Being a member means that you are responsible for the operation of the co-op. Democracy is not a spectator sport. Many people appear to have a hard time understanding this.

There is also increased opportunity for interpersonal conflict. Everybody has to work together.

Another significant issue is maintenance, especially saving for large scale maintenance. Many co-ops struggle with this.

### Special Minor Co-ops

#### Heat Pump Co-ops

One of the long term issues facing us now is how to heat and cool housing with a low carbon footprint.

It turns out that in ground heat pumps are more economical at scales larger than small buildings.

In the context of this project it means we should try to spread the benefits and costs of heat pumps to the surrounding neighbourhood. One way of doing this would be to create a separate neighbourhood heating/cooling co-op and invite the existing neighbours to join. It would be financed with the same member loan/monthly charged structure as the housing co-op. If a member of that co-op sold their home to the housing co-op the member loan would be picked up by the housing co-op.

#### Parking Co-ops

One of the issues with 6-plexes in the suburbs is parking. Putting it on site means underground, likely expensive, inflexible, and puts more cars on the street you live on.

An alternative is to buy a property on a connecting street and put parking there. You could start with a lot and build a garage when that gets full. The garage could include charging stations for each stall.

If you make this a separate co-op other local residents could also make use of it. This would likely be more attractive as electric cars become a larger part of the fleet mix.

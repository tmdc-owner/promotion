notes:
The Formalization Phase is structured in two parts: **Set-up** and **Execution**.

The **Set-up Phase** begins once contributors determine that the Level of Interest threshold is likely to be met. This stage focuses on legal and operational preparedness — including drafting incorporation documents, confirming regulatory paths, and finalizing onboarding protocols.

The **Execution Phase** moves these plans into action: formally incorporating entities, processing early member sign-ups, handling escrow, and electing the first Development Co-op board.

This phase ensures TMDC is legally grounded and operationally ready for construction and community financing.

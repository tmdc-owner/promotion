title: Start-Up Initiative
layout: project
phase: Start Up

summary: "Establish TMDC’s public presence, engagement infrastructure, and early ecosystem."
description: "This project is focused on establishing the public-facing presence, early engagement channels, and strategic ecosystem of the TMDC. The primary goal is to pass the Level of Interest decision point by gathering enough registrations and demonstrating strong early momentum through key partnerships and contributors. It is not concerned with legal incorporation or formal governance setup — those are covered under the Formalization Project."

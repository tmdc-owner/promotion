title: Build Candidates Pre-Work
layout: project
phase: Operation
quarter: 2025Q4
status: planned
lead: TBD
summary: "Prepare a high-quality pipeline of build-ready site candidates and aligned partners for co-op-led development."
description: "This project ensures that by the time TMDC’s co-operative entities take full control, they are set up for success with a vetted set of candidate sites, development options, and aligned delivery partners. The focus is on pre-research, regulatory scanning, and outreach to align potential build opportunities with zoning, financial, and mission criteria."

  - text: "Pre-assessed sites may later fail due to affordability or construction constraints"
  - text: "Building trust with partners early, without overpromising timelines, is key"
  - text: "Must balance detail and scalability — this framework should be reusable"

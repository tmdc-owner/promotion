## What Are We Building?

The Toronto Multiplex Development Co-operative (TMDC) is building a scalable system for creating **community-owned, resident-governed housing**. This housing takes the form of small, energy-efficient multiplexes that are affordable because they are **non-profit, non-speculative**, and operated by the people who live in them.

The initiative isn't just about building housing—it’s about building a system that communities can operate, sustain, and grow together.

## A System of Co-ops

The TMDC model is built around a network of co-operatives, each playing a distinct role in the development and ongoing management of housing. These co-ops are designed to work together in a modular, scalable way.

### The Three Core Co-ops

<details name="coops">
  <summary>1. Development Co-op</summary>
  <p>Where the process begins</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Identifies land, purchases properties, commissions designs, and oversees construction.</li>
    <li><strong>Who it serves:</strong> Future residents—people who join the waitlist and provide early-stage support.</li>
    <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It ensures the development process is driven by community need, not profit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additional responsibilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Onboards prospective members through interviews and education</li>
    <li>Manages initial member loans and escrow funds</li>
  </ul>
</details>

  <summary>2. Financing Co-op</summary>
  <p>Ethical, community-backed financing</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Provides access to capital through the sale of community bonds and the issuance of mortgages.</li>
    <li><strong>Who it serves:</strong> Operating co-ops (see below) that manage each housing site.</li>
    <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It replaces for-profit banks with a mission-aligned, transparent financial partner.</li>
  </ul>

<details name="coops">
  <summary>3. Operating Co-op (Housing Co-op)</summary>
  <p>Living together, running it together</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Maintains and governs the co-op housing building after it's completed.</li>
    <li><strong>Who it serves:</strong> Residents living in the building.</li>
    <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It gives each household real decision-making power over their housing conditions, costs, and community culture.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each operating co-op is responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing operations and maintenance</li>
    <li>Hosting member meetings and electing a board</li>
    <li>Setting rent levels based on real costs (not market speculation)</li>
  </ul>

## Why This Works

This cooperative structure is designed to be:

- **Participatory** – members are actively involved in decisions at every stage
- **Modular** – new buildings and co-ops can be added over time
- **Transparent** – every dollar and decision is member-visible
- **Resilient** – the system distributes responsibility and avoids central bottlenecks

Together, these co-ops create a **community-controlled pipeline for ongoing housing development** that prioritizes stability, equity, and long-term sustainability.

<!-- ### What About Funding?

We’ve intentionally separated the mechanics of funding from this overview to keep things simple and focused.

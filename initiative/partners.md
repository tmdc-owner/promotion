summary: Building Housing Means Building Relationships
layout: page
---

TMDC isn’t just building co-op housing—it’s **rebuilding the systems** that make housing possible in the first place.

To do that, we rely on intentional partnerships with organizations that align with our values and help us bring this model to life—ethically, sustainably, and at scale.

## Why We Work With Partners

No single actor can deliver stable, community-owned housing alone.

From land acquisition to design, financing, regulation, and governance—TMDC depends on a **collaborative web of relationships** to make co-op housing viable outside of traditional development and real estate models.

### Our partners help us:

- Navigate regulatory, legal, and zoning environments
- Secure and steward land in the public interest
- Design and build efficient, livable multiplexes
- Structure ethical financing tools
- Engage and organize community members

### We work with partners who:

- Are committed to **non-extractive systems** and long-term affordability
- Value **radical transparency** and community accountability
- Respect the principles of **co-operative ownership** and democratic governance
- See housing as a **collective responsibility**, not a commodity

We believe that partnerships are not transactional—they’re **transformational**.

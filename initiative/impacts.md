## Our Theory of Change

If we design and launch a transparent, community-owned housing development model that works within current zoning and finances itself ethically, then:

- People who want secure, affordable housing will finally have a path in
- Communities can reclaim control over land, housing, and neighborhood design
- We can build a lasting alternative to speculative real estate

We believe small-scale, resident-led development can reshape how cities grow — from the inside out.

---

## Why This Works

### Non-Profit = Affordable

Co-op housing doesn’t include landlord profits. That means:

- Rent only covers **actual costs** (mortgage, maintenance, reserves)
- As mortgages are paid off, housing charges **drop in real terms**
- Residents have **governance rights** to cap or reduce costs

Over time, TMDC co-ops become **more affordable** — not less.

### Predictable, Transparent Costs

Rents rise slowly and predictably, following inflation — not the market. When the mortgage is paid, costs flatten or even decline.

### Good for the City, Too

Suburbs are expensive for cities to maintain. Denser, walkable neighborhoods cost less — and serve people better.

TMDC’s multiplexes are built in the suburbs — but they behave more like urban infrastructure: efficient, walkable, and serviceable.

### Social and Environmental Impact

TMDC multiplexes support:

- **Climate resilience** – High-efficiency design and local living
- **Reduced car dependency** – More people near transit and services
- **Public land stewardship** – Through partnerships with Land Trusts
- **Democratic participation** – Residents control their housing
- **Financial literacy and equity** – Through co-op education and ownership

### Core Values in Practice

- **Transparency** – Every dollar, every decision is member-visible
- **Democracy** – Residents shape their own housing and neighborhoods
- **Affordability** – Costs are capped by reality, not rent markets
- **Non-speculation** – Land is held for community benefit
- **Scalability** – One co-op at a time, with no maximum size

### Long-Term Impacts

- Increase in **non-speculative housing supply**
- Decrease in **suburban infrastructure costs**
- Expansion of **democratic governance in housing**
- Growth of **climate-smart, people-first design**

## Our Operational Principles

_These principles translate our values into everyday decisions and organizational practices. They keep us grounded in our mission as we grow._

We hold ourselves accountable not just to what we build — but how we build it. These principles govern how TMDC operates, collaborates, and grows:

| #   | Principle                      | What It Means                                                   | Why It Matters                                                                                                        |
| --- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Not-for-Profit**             | All TMDC organizations are non-profit entities.                 | This ensures housing charges are tied to real costs — not investor returns.                                           |
| 2   | **Democratic Control**         | Every organization is a co-op governed by its members.          | Aligns decision-making with lived experience and resident priorities.                                                 |
| 3   | **Radical Transparency**       | Finances, governance, and processes are open by default.        | Builds trust and invites participation — essential for community control.                                             |
| 4   | **Scalable Modularity**        | Designed to grow through repeatable, small-scale developments.  | Allows continuous building on single suburban lots using efficient, replicable processes.                             |
| 5   | **Regulatory Alignment**       | All development is “as-of-right” — within zoning rules.         | Avoids costly delays and keeps momentum sustainable.                                                                  |
| 6   | **Institutional Independence** | TMDC is independent of both government and private developers.  | Ensures decisions are mission-driven, not market-driven — while still open to aligned partnerships.                   |
| 7   | **Manifest Legitimacy**        | TMDC must not only be trustworthy — but be seen as trustworthy. | Public transparency, clear structure, and alignment with regulations build credibility for funders and members alike. |

## Building the System That Builds Housing

The TMDC model is designed to be scalable and repeatable—but getting there requires deliberate, staged setup. This roadmap outlines the key phases needed to turn a community-led housing concept into a functioning pipeline for stable, resident-owned multiplexes.

Implementation focuses on **establishing foundational institutions**, **securing community and financial commitment**, and **launching the first housing projects** in a way that sets the tone for future growth.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Initialization

_Design, organize, and align the model_

**Goals:**

- Finalize the co-op model and legal structures
- Launch core communication materials and engagement tools
- Begin community outreach and contributor recruitment
- Develop partnerships with key technical and legal stakeholders

**Outputs:**

- TMDC website and registration system
- Public-facing strategy and messaging toolkit
- Initial content explaining the co-op and financing model
- Early partner conversations and letters of interest

**Estimated:**
Now → Early 2025

### Phase 2: Formalization

_Secure member and financial commitment_

**Goals:**

- Register the legal entities (Development, Finance, and Operating Co-ops)
- Begin intake for member households
- Launch community bond offering
- Formalize partnership agreements (architects, CLT, legal advisors, etc.)

**Outputs:**

- Signed membership agreements and collected member loans
- Incorporation documents for co-ops
- Public community bond terms and offering platform
- Escrow and reserve accounts opened (via credit union partner)

**Estimated:**
Mid 2025

### Phase 3: Operation

_Acquire land, build housing, and grow the model_

**Goals:**

- Purchase first site(s) and commission design + permitting
- Begin construction of pilot multiplexes
- Onboard residents into the operating co-op
- Refine the model and prepare for replication

**Outputs:**

- Construction underway on first co-op housing
- Resident onboarding and democratic governance in place
- Transparent reporting on costs and outcomes
- Toolkit and roadmap for expanding to additional sites

**Estimated:**
Late 2025 → Ongoing

## Scaling Through Systems

Once the initial co-ops are operational, the system becomes **self-extending**:

- New members join the waitlist and contribute early-stage capital
- Co-op infrastructure and expertise are re-used for new builds
- Community bonds finance repeat development
- Partnerships deepen with each cycle

Each new housing project strengthens the system, reduces future costs, and grows the network of community-owned housing across Toronto.

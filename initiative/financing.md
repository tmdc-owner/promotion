TMDC’s financial model is designed for **community resilience**, **economic fairness**, and **long-term stewardship**. We’ve created a system where money, land, and buildings are treated not as assets to extract from—but as tools to circulate value within a community.

Our approach replaces speculative, profit-driven development with **community-controlled financial pathways** that support the creation, operation, and sustainability of co-operative housing.

## The Financial Ecosystem

TMDC’s financing framework works through a network of values-aligned institutions:

| Institution                         | Responsibilities                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development Co-op**               | Handles early-stage capital, planning, and land acquisition                |
| **Finance Co-op**                   | Raises and distributes ethical capital through bonds and mortgages         |
| **Operating Co-ops**                | Hold and manage buildings for the benefit of their residents               |
| **Credit Union** _(future partner)_ | Safeguards reserves and escrow accounts for long-term stability            |
| **Community Land Trust (CLT)**      | Holds land outside the speculative market, in trust for future generations |

This creates a system where **the community builds housing for itself**, and **nobody profits from the transaction** except the people who live there—and the public.
Together, these actors form a **closed-loop system** for building and sustaining affordable, co-operative housing.

## How the Money Works

Each multiplex moves through three financial phases. Each phase has distinct funding mechanisms and stewardship responsibilities:

        <td>Land acquisition, design finalization, and construction</td>

          <p><strong>Community Bonds</strong> short-term, fixed-rate debt issued by the Finance Co-op to values-aligned investors</p>
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>Turning plans into buildings—Funds are directed through the <strong>Finance Co-op</strong>, which exists to raise ethical capital and insulate housing projects from market volatility.</p>
        <p>This phase carries no rental income, so bonds are crucial for bridging the gap.</p>
        <p>Land may be acquired by the <strong>Development Co-op</strong> and then transferred to a <strong>Community Land Trust</strong>, such as the Toronto Indigenous Community Land Trust, to ensure it remains permanently outside the speculative market.</p>

            <p><strong>Member Equity</strong> (~5% of unit cost per household)</p>
            <p><strong>Mortgages</strong> from the Finance Co-op, backed by long-term community bond sales</p>
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>Stable housing, cost-based governance—Mortgage terms are designed to be stable and fair, often indexed to inflation with a modest premium (e.g. CPI + 2.25%).</p>
        <p>Funds are used strictly to cover costs—not to generate profit. Rents are predictable and capped by the real expenses of running the co-op.</p>

## From Contributions to Collective Assets

In the TMDC model, **money isn’t consumed—it’s transformed.** Member loans, bond purchases, and equity contributions don’t just pay bills; they **create lasting, community-held infrastructure.**

### Input Contributions

Here’s how each input becomes part of the system that builds and preserves housing for the long term:

<div class="grid">
<article>
  <header><hgroup><h4>Member Loans</h4><p>Early participation = enabling development</p></hgroup></header>
  <p>Paid by households joining the waitlist.</p>
  <p>Used to fund early legal, design, and coordination costs.</p>
  <p>Held by the Development Co-op, governed by those same members.</p>
  <p>Repaid over time or converted into equity once housing is secured</p>
  <footer><p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>These loans activate the co-op. They’re not a fee—they’re a first stake in what’s being built.</p></footer>
</article>
<article>
  <header><hgroup><h4>Community Bonds</h4><p>Aligned capital = construction power</p></hgroup></header>
    <p>Sold to public supporters or institutional allies.</p>
    <p>Used to acquire land and fund construction.</p>
    <p>Repaid through long-term mortgage payments by residents.</p>
    <p>Issued and managed by the Finance Co-op, a specialized financial body.</p>
  <footer><p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>These bonds convert community trust into tangible buildings—without relying on banks or developers.</p></footer>
</article>
<article>
  <header><hgroup><h4>Member Equity</h4><p>Resident commitment = housing ownership</p></hgroup></header>
    <p>Paid by households moving into completed buildings (typically ~5% of cost).</p>
    <p>Used to cover initial operating capital and finalize construction debt.</p>
    <p>Combined with a mortgage from the Finance Co-op to complete the financing stack.</p>
    <p>Held collectively through the Operating Co-op.</p>
  <footer><p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>These contributions ensure residents have both skin in the game and a say in how the home is run.</p></footer>
</article>
</div>

### **Produced Assets**

_Money becomes housing, but also governance_

When funding is deployed through this model, it produces more than just physical structures:

| **Input**     | **Becomes**             | **Held By**                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Member loans  | Organizational capacity | Development Co-op (governed by members) |
| Bonds         | Buildings + land        | Finance Co-op + Land Trust              |
| Member equity | Community-owned homes   | Operating Co-op                         |

In many cases, the **land itself is transferred to a Community Land Trust (CLT)** to ensure permanent affordability. The building sits atop that land and is operated by the co-op.

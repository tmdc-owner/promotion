## Web Page Copy Snippets

**Hero Banner**

> What if your landlord wasn't looking for profit?  
> **Co-operative housing. Built by us, for us.**

**Why It Works**

> TMDC multiplexes are owned and governed by the people who live in them. That means no landlords, no rent hikes, and no outside investors controlling your home. Just cost-covering housing with shared ownership.

**Call to Action**

> We’re looking for 200 founding signups to launch our first buildings.  
> **Get involved and shape your future.**

## Notes on Messaging Tone

- Use **hopeful, empowering** language
- Avoid jargon—speak clearly and directly
- Call out the **systemic structures** that aren’t working, not individual people
- Emphasize **community control, stability, and participation**
- Use emotional range to meet people where they are: anger, frustration, curiosity, hope, and inspiration
- Instead of "profit-free," consider **"social profit," "non-speculative,"** or **"community return on investment"** to resonate across values and mindsets

## ✨ Together, We Can Reimagine Housing

This initiative isn’t just about buildings — it’s about creating a new system. A better future takes many hands.

Join us in building it.

## How to Contribute

Whether you’re a prospective resident, a technical expert, a builder, a neighbor, or a values-aligned investor — **you have a role to play** in shaping the future of housing in Toronto.

### Households: Join the Movement

If you want to live in a co-op multiplex — or even just support the idea — **preregister to join our future housing co-ops**. This helps us:

- Measure demand
- Demonstrate traction
- Reach our 200+ household milestone for launch

<ul>
    {% for project in site.projects %}
      {% assign open_roles = project.team | where: "status", "Needed" %}
      {% if open_roles.size > 0 %}
        <li>Project: <a href="{{ project.url | relative_url }}">{{ project.title }}</a>
          <ul>
            {% for role in open_roles %}
              <li>{{ role.role }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
